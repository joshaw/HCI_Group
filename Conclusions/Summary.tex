\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

Our aim was to design a mobile booking system for sports centres that would
allow users to search multiple facilities at the same time and compare results.
This is something that can be done with many booking applications for other
services.

Through our research into mobile booking apps and sports facilities websites,
we identified key design features for our application. We also found that the
interface may have to present a large amount of data. Readability and filtering
results would have to be considered as well as an easy-to-use, clean interface.
We then used these findings to design our first generation prototypes. These
were based on the three navigation styles outlined by Apple Inc; hierarchical,
flat, and content-driven.

We evaluated the first generation prototypes using Nielsenâ€™s heuristics and
user personas. We found that each design had features that were useful and
satisfied specific scenarios. These were then incorporated into the design of
the second prototype.

The second prototype was able to achieve more than the previous designs but the
cognitive walkthroughs and questionnaire results show there are some areas that
would need further development if this application were to be taken forward.
