\subsection{Prototype 2}

\subsubsection{Presentation}
\textbf{Tools:} balsamiq

\paragraph{Rationale}
This prototype is a hierarchical design displaying each screen as a series of
steps which the user must progress through before searching. This prototype
also focuses on a very simple, easy to use interface.

Choose all criteria before searching
Home Screen
The home screen offers a choice of three menus

\marginFig{img/firstPrototypes/home_screen}{The home screen}{fig:Pro2Home}

1.       Make a booking – takes users to the hierarchy of search screens to enter their criteria
2.       Change a booking – takes the user to a screen which allows them to change their criteria if alternative results permit it
3.       Cancel booking – takes the user to a screen of their current bookings and the user can select which booking they would like to cancel. Whether a refund is possible would depend on the sport centre

Search screen1
On selecting ‘Make a booking’, the user will be directed to the initial search screen which will be the first step in their search

Figure2 – first search screen

1.       The help button takes the user to a guide on how to complete the current page along with FAQ’s
2.       The progress bar shows the user how far along in the search process they are
3.       The user can choose which sport they would like to play from a drop down menu. The drop down menu shows recent search results at the top, then list all available sports in alphabetical order
4.       The user must press on the calendar icon which will present them with a calendar to select which date they would like to play
5.       The time is chosen by selecting the hour and minutes from drop down bars
6.       The user can select how long they would like to play for, chosen from a drop down bar with half hour intervals
7.       Takes the user to the next step in the search process

Search screen2
The next screen focuses on location.

Figure 3 – second search screen

1.       The search box allows the user to specify their location by either town, city or postcode. When the user begins to type a location, the system will suggest locations based on what they have already typed
2.       The user can use a horizontal slider to specify how far they are willing to travel to play the sport
3.       If the user requires disables access they can tick the checkbox and the results will only show sports centres which are wheelchair accessible

Search Screen3
The user is then brought to the final search screen where they may be able to get discounts

Figure4 – search screen3

1.       Numeric stepper to specify how many people the booking is for
2.       The user may be eligible for discounts if they are a child, student or pensioner. They can tick the suitable checkboxes if they fall into any of these categories
3.       If the user has a strict budget, they can choose to only see results which do not exceed a  particular price
4.       Pressing the search button takes the user to a screen displaying the results of the search
Results Screen
Screen showing the results of the search

Figure5 – results screen

1.       The user can sort the results by distance, price or time
2.       If the results are not suitable, the user may wish to change their search criteria, the ‘amend search’ button will take them back to the first search screen where they can alter their original preferences
3.       Each result informs the user of the time, date, venue name, distance from the venue and the price. The price shows the total price for all people. The user can scroll down the page to view all matching results
4.       Pressing the buttons displaying the price will take the user to a more detailed description of the booking and a link to an external pay site or the website of that sports facility to pay for the booking.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
	\begin{longtable}{p{0.3\textwidth} c p{0.6\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Comment}\\
		\midrule
		Visibility of system status &  & Each screen shows the user their
		progress in the search process \\

		Match between system and the real world &  & Each field  \\

		User control and freedom & $-$ & The hierarchical nature of the system
		prevents the user from switching screens easily. If they choose to go
		back they will lose the information they have already typed on the
		screen they left. Freedom is also restricted as the user is required to
		fill all fields. For example they must pick a particular sport at a
		particular time \\

		Consistency and standards &  &  \\

		Error prevention & + & Due to the large buttons and very simple
		interface, there is very little chance of user error. Although the drop
		down menus could get a little fiddly. If the user does accidentally
		book the wrong option, they may have the opportunity to change or
		cancel this booking \\

		Recognition rather than re-call &  &  \\

		Flexibility and efficiency use & 0 & Lacks efficiency due to the fact
		that the user must progress through all search screens filling in all
		fields before they can search \\

		Aesthetic and minimalist de-sign & + & The design is very simple so as
		not to cause any confusion to the user \\

		Help users recognize, diag-nose, and recover from errors & + & If the
		user tries to move to the next screen having not filled a field or
		filled it incorrectly,  they will be shown a descriptive error message
		in red above that field \\

		Help and documentation & + & The help button displayed on every screen
		takes the user to a guide on how to complete the current page along
		with FAQ?s \\

	\begin{longtable}{p{0.12\textwidth} p{0.3\textwidth} c p{0.45\textwidth}}
		\toprule
		\textbf{User} & \textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Comment}\\
		\midrule
		\textbf{Elderly} & Searching for new sports in the area and notifying
		his wife of the booking. & $-$ & Howard may find using the drop down
		menus difficult with his osteoarthritis. There is no feature to notify
		people of the booking \\

		& Racquet sport with 4 friends on Friday & 0 & Can select four people
		to play using drop down menu. Would have to specify which racquet sport
		he wishes to play. No bulk book feature \\

		& Swimming nearby with knee pain & + & If Howard does not wish to
		travel far he can either filter the results by distance or specify a
		maximum distance he is willing to travel (search screen2). If Howards
		knee pain is particularly bad he may wish to swim somewhere which
		doesn?t require climbing any stairs. He can do this by ticking the
		wheelchair accessible checkbox \\

		\midrule
		\textbf{Working} & Team sport on Friday including screen
		sharing with friends & $-$ & The app would not support this scenario as
		there is no option to search for just team sports. There is also no
		current feature to support screen sharing but this could be
		incorporated into the final design \\

		& Change/cancel booking at late notice & 0 & Janet has this option on
		the home screen. Although the app cannot guarantee the venue allows
		cancellations \\

		& Outdoor sport early on Saturday & 0 & Useful as Janet can specify a
		time. But again, there is no flexibility in choosing a sport \\

		\midrule
		\textbf{Student} & Tennis court at specific time & + & This
		scenario is tailored this prototypes design. Jenny can specify that she
		would like to play tennis at a particular time on a particular day and
		how long she would like to play for \\

		& Weekday evening session must be on clay & 0 & This could be something
		to incorporate on the screen showing the booking in more detail, along
		with other information such as court number \\

		& Weekly practice with friend with reminders & $-$ & There is no
		notification feature with this prototype. The regular weekly booking
		feature could also be something we incorporate in the screen showing
		more detail about the booking \\

		\midrule
		\textbf{Child} & Outdoor sport close to home or on a bus route with
		coach & $-$ & No feature showing any transport routes. Joe would also
		have to specify which outdoor sport he is interested in playing \\

		& Booking several squash courts for after school tournament & $-$ & With
		the current design, Joe would have to use the number of players field
		(4 people = 1 court) to portray how many courts he needs. He can
		specify how long they need the courts based on how long they think
		tournament will last. However he would need to choose a particular day
		\\

		& Looking for high quality tennis court & $-$ & There is currently no way
		of finding the quality of the sport facilities. Pete can however, use
		the sliders to increase the maximum distance and price they are willing
		to pay \\
