\subsection{Prototype 2}

\subsubsection{Presentation}
\textbf{Tools:} Balsamiq

\paragraph{Rationale}
This prototype is a hierarchical design displaying each screen as a series of
steps which the user must progress through before searching. This prototype
also focuses on a very simple, easy to use interface.

\paragraph{Home Screen}
\marginpar{%
	\begin{overpic}[width=0.8\marginparwidth]
		{img/firstPrototypes/Pro2Home_Screen}
		\put(60,66){\framebox{1}}
		\put(60,40){\framebox{2}}
		\put(60,14){\framebox{3}}
		% \put(46,23){\framebox{3}}
		% \put(62,92){\framebox{4}}
		% \put(5,45){\framebox{5}}
	\end{overpic}
	\captionof{figure}{The home screen}\label{fig:Pro2Home_Screen}
}

The home screen offers a choice of three menus

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Make a booking; takes users to the hierarchy of search screens to
		enter their criteria
	\item Change a booking; takes the user to a screen which allows them to
		change their criteria if alternative results permit it
	\item Cancel booking; takes the user to a screen of their current bookings
		and the user can select which booking they would like to cancel.
		Whether a refund is possible would depend on the sports centre
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Search screen 1}
% \marginpar{%
% 	\begin{overpic}[width=\marginparwidth]
% 		{img/firstPrototypes/Pro2First_Screen}
% 		% \put(-7,94){\framebox{1}}
% 		% \put(62,70){\framebox{2}}
% 		% \put(3,22){\framebox{3}}

% 		% \put(5,45){\framebox{5}}
% 	\end{overpic}
% 	\captionof{figure}{First search screen}\label{fig:Pro2First_Screen}
% }

On selecting `Make a booking', the user will be directed to the initial search
screen which will be the first step in their search

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{overpic}[width=0.8\linewidth]
    	{img/firstPrototypes/Pro2First_Screen}
    	\put(68,48){\framebox{1}}
    	\put(28,44){\framebox{2}}
    	\put(8,39){\framebox{3}}
    	\put(88,49){\framebox{4}}
    	\put(68,22){\framebox{5}}
    	\put(68,13){\framebox{6}}
    	\put(68,3){\framebox{7}}
	\end{overpic}
	\captionof{figure}{First search screen.}\label{fig:Pro2First_Screen}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The help button takes the user to a guide on how to complete the
		current page along with FAQ's.
	\item The progress bar shows the user how far along they are in the search
		process.
	\item The user can choose which sport they would like to play from a drop
		down menu. The drop down menu shows recent search results at the top,
		then lists all available sports in alphabetical order.
	\item The user must press on the calendar icon which will present them with
		a calendar to select which date they would like to play.
	\item The time is chosen by selecting the hour and minutes from drop down
		bars.
	\item The user can select how long they would like to play for, chosen from
		a drop down bar with half hour intervals.
	\item The `Next' button takes the user to the next step in the search
		process.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Search screen 2}
\marginpar{%
	\vspace{-1cm}
	\begin{overpic}[width=0.8\marginparwidth]
		{img/firstPrototypes/Pro2Second_Screen}
		\put(61,58){\framebox{1}}
		\put(61,29){\framebox{2}}
		\put(61,19){\framebox{3}}
	\end{overpic}
	\captionof{figure}{Second search screen}\label{fig:Pro2Second_Screen}
}

The next screen focuses on location.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The search box allows the user to specify their location by either
		town, city or postcode. When the user begins to type a location, the
		system will suggest locations based on what they have already typed
	\item The user can use a horizontal slider to specify how far they are
		willing to travel to play the sport
	\item If the user requires disabled access they can tick the checkbox and
		the results will only show sports centres which are wheelchair
		accessible
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Search Screen 3}
\marginpar{%
	\begin{overpic}[width=0.8\marginparwidth]
		{img/firstPrototypes/Pro2Third_Screen}
		\put(61,69){\framebox{1}}
		\put(61,47){\framebox{2}}
		\put(61,22){\framebox{3}}
		\put(61,6){\framebox{4}}
	\end{overpic}
	\captionof{figure}{Third search screen}\label{fig:Pro2Third_Screen}
}
The user is then brought to the final search screen where they may be able to
get discounts

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Numeric stepper to specify how many people the booking is for.
	\item The user may be eligible for discounts if they are a child, student
		or pensioner. They can tick the suitable checkboxes if they fall into
		any of these categories.
	\item If the user has a strict budget, they can choose to only see results
		which do not exceed a  particular price.
	\item Pressing the search button takes the user to a screen displaying the
		results of the search.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Results Screen}
\marginpar{%
	\begin{overpic}[width=\marginparwidth]
		{img/firstPrototypes/Pro2Results_screen}
		\put(11,73){\framebox{1}}
		\put(43,51){\framebox{2}}
		\put(42,23){\framebox{3}}
		\put(102,20){\framebox{4}}
	\end{overpic}
	\captionof{figure}{Results screen}\label{fig:Pro2Results_Screen}
}
Screen showing the results of the search

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The user can sort the results by distance, price or time.
	\item If the results are not suitable, the user may wish to change their
		search criteria, the `amend search' button will take them back to the
		first search screen where they can alter their original preferences.
	\item Each result informs the user of the time, date, venue name, distance
		from the venue and the price. The price shows the total price for all
		people. The user can scroll down the page to view all matching results.
	\item Pressing the buttons displaying the price will take the user to a
		more detailed description of the booking and a link to an external pay
		site or the website of that sports facility to pay for the booking.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Heuristic Evaluation}

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\begin{longtabu}{p{0.3\linewidth} c X}
	\toprule
	\textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Comment}\\
	\midrule
	Visibility of system status & $+$ & Each screen shows the user their
	progress in the search process \\

	Match between system and the real world & $+$ & Each field is self
	explanatory and is clear what is asked of the user.  \\

	User control and freedom & $-$ & The hierarchical nature of the system
	prevents the user from switching screens easily. If they choose to go back
	they will lose the information they have already typed on the screen they
	left. Freedom is also restricted as the user is required to fill all
	fields. For example they must pick a particular sport at a particular time.
	\\

	Consistency and standards & $-$ & The way users specify their criteria
	varies throughout the search, for example horizontal sliders and steppers
	to achieve numerical values. Although this would not reduce the clarity of
	what is asked of the user. \\

	Error prevention & + & Due to the large buttons and very simple interface,
	there is very little chance of user error. Although the drop down menus
	could get a little fiddly. If the user does accidentally book the wrong
	option, they may have the opportunity to change or cancel this booking. \\

	Recognition rather than re-call & $+$ & Information required on the current
	search screen does not depend on information on the previous screen. \\

	Flexibility and efficiency use & 0 & Lacks efficiency due to the fact that
	the user must progress through all search screens filling in all fields
	before they can search. \\

	Aesthetic and minimalist design & $+$ & The design is very simple so as not
	to cause any confusion to the user. The home screen, for example, displays
	only 3 large buttons to allow the user to chose which path they would like
	to take \\

	Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors & $+$\ & If the
	user tries to move to the next screen having not filled a field or filled
	it incorrectly,  they will be shown a descriptive error message in red
	above that field \\

	Help and documentation & $+$ & The help button displayed on every screen
	takes the user to a guide on how to complete the current page along with
	FAQ's \\

\subsubsection{Persona Evaluation}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
\begin{longtabu}{p{0.3\linewidth} c X}
	\toprule
	\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Comment}\\
	\midrule
	\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textbf{Elderly}}\\
	\midrule
	Searching for new sports in the area and notifying his wife of the booking.
	& $-$ & Howard may find using the drop down menus difficult with his
	osteoarthritis. There is no feature to notify people of the booking \\

	Racquet sport with 4 friends on Friday & 0 & Can select four people to play
	using drop down menu. Would have to specify which racquet sport he wishes
	to play. No bulk book feature. \\

	Swimming nearby with knee pain & $+$ & If Howard does not wish to travel
	far he can either filter the results by distance or specify a maximum
	distance he is willing to travel. If Howard's knee pain is particularly bad
	he may wish to swim somewhere which doesn't require climbing any stairs. He
	can do this by ticking the checkbox for wheelchair accessible locations. \\

	\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textbf{Working}}\\
	\midrule
	Team sport on Friday including screen sharing with friends & $-$ & The
	application would not support this scenario as there is no option to search
	for just team sports. There is also no current feature to support screen
	sharing but this could be incorporated into the final design. \\

	Change/cancel booking at late notice & 0 & Janet has this option on the
	home screen. Although the application cannot guarantee the venue allows
	cancellations, she can chose to change her booking, or cancel if she is
	unable to rearrange. However, the application cannot guarantee the venue
	allows cancellations. \\

	Outdoor sport early on Saturday & 0 & Useful as Janet can specify a time.
	But again, there is no flexibility in choosing a sport. \\

	\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textbf{Student}}\\
	\midrule
	Tennis court at specific time & $+$ & This scenario is tailored to this
	prototype's design. Jenny can specify that she would like to play tennis at
	a particular time on a particular day and how long she would like to play
	for \\

	Weekday evening session must be on clay & 0 & This could be something that
	could be incorporated on the screen showing the booking in more detail,
	along with other information such as the court number. \\

	Weekly practice with friend with reminders & $-$ & There is no notification
	feature available with this prototype. The regular weekly booking feature
	could also be something that is incorporated in to the screen showing more
	detail about the booking. \\

	\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textbf{Child}}\\
	\midrule
	Outdoor sport close to home or on a bus route with coach & $-$ & No feature
	showing any transport routes. Joe would also have to specify which outdoor
	sport he is interested in playing \\

	Booking several squash courts for after school tournament & $-$ & With the
	current design, Joe would have to use the number of players field (4 people
	= 1 court) to portray how many courts he needs. He can specify how long
	they need the courts based on how long they think the tournament will last.
	However he would need to choose a particular day.  \\

	Looking for high quality tennis court & $-$ & There is currently no way of
	finding the quality of the sport facilities. Pete can however, use the
	sliders to increase the maximum distance and price they are willing to pay.
	\\

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\label{ssub:hierarchy_Conclusion}

Based on the heuristic evaluation we can conclude that the hierarchical nature
of this prototype would not suit our application as it lacks efficiency and
freedom due to the fact that the user must progress through all search screens
filling in all fields before they can search. It also prevents the user from
switching screens easily. For a more flexible and efficient experience, a flat
design may be more appropriate.

We can however say that this prototype is very clear and structured, and with
its simplistic interface it reduces the chance of user error.

Playing out various user scenarios has highlighted some important drawbacks
with this prototype. The main issue being there is no leeway in which sport
they wish to play. A more relaxed approach where the user can select a variety
of sports would be beneficial to the user.
