Following the evaluation of the first prototypes, there are a number
of features we plan to include in our second prototype.

The evaluations, particularly those against the user scenarios, highlighted a
number of features which are missing from all of the initial prototypes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The ability to make several bookings at once.
	\item Confirmation messages when performing certain actions, such as making
		a booking.
	\item Grouping sports, such as team or outdoor sports, when searching for a
		sport.
	\item Clarification on booking cancellations as some venues may not allow
		cancellations at all or at least not without a certain amount of
		notice.
	\item Including public transport options in the location search
	\item An indication of location quality, such as through user reviews.
\end{itemize}
