We have developed a second prototype based on what we have learnt from the
evaluation of our first prototypes. This prototype has more functionality than
any of the first prototypes to allow us to better evaluate the design against
heuristics and scenarios and through usability testing. The basic navigation
between screens is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pro2outline}, while each screen is
explained in more detail below in Section~\ref{sec:secondprotopresentation}.
