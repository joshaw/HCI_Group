\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

If you currently want to book sports facilities, the only way to search
is directly through the individual sports center's websites, or through
direct communication. If someone is flexible in the location or choice
of sport, they are required to search multiple locations to find the
best compromise.

In addition to the difficulties of checking multiple websites, often
each of these websites are unintuitive and difficult to use, requiring
the user to know exactly when and where they want to use the facilities
and often not giving clear information about other possible factors
such as cost.

Here, we propose a new, unified interface for finding a time, location
and the cost for playing any of a number of sports, at any of the
available locations within a given distance or relative to a different
location.
