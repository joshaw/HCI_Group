Description


Howard lives on the outskirts of York with his wife. Howard’s wife works most days of the week as a supermarket shop assistant and their youngest son has now left home for university in London, leaving Howard with a lot of spare time on his hands. To help stay connected with his dad, Howard’s son has bought him a smartphone in spite of Howard’s inexperience and frustration with technology. For this reason he also prefers not to put any sensitive information in his phone, like credit card information.
        

Though Howard was very active in his working years, he has come to enjoy a more sedate life since retiring last year from his job as a construction manager.  Recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis, Howard has been advised to exercise more regularly to help strengthen his muscles and joints. Howard has always been competitive, and would happily try his hand at any sport he could find. However, joint pain in his knees often restricts him from some high impact activities.


No longer able to drive, Howard relies on walking and public transport to get around during the week when his wife is not at home to drive him.

Main goals


        
- Increase his overall physical activity.
- Maintain his independence from his wife.
- Limit his time using computers.
- Pay for the activity at the venue.


Scenarios


- Howard’s doctor has just told him he needs to start doing more activity. Howard has a lot of free time, but he doesn’t know what sports he wants to play and doesn’t know what facilities there are in York so he searches on his phone to see what his options are. 
        

- Howard has gathered a group of 4 old friends to play sport with him this Friday when they are all free. They’re happy to play anything involving a racquet. If it goes well, he wants to make it a regularly weekly activity.

- Howard has been having a lot of knee pain over the last few days so his doctor has suggested he try swimming. He doesn’t think he can travel too far from his house and is worried he would need disabled access at the pool and doesn’t want to feel rushed at the pool by younger and faster swimmers.




Pain points (?)


- joint pain in his hands often causes difficulty and discomfort when using his mobile phone.
- has very little patience with technology.
- would often prefer to play close to public transport facilities.
- joint pain in his knees often makes walking up stairs very uncomfortable.
