Description


        Joe lives at home in a small town with his father, Pete. He is very active playing many sports at school and outside and enjoys trying new sports whenever the opportunity is available. His father is keen to encourage him to participate in a wide range of activities so that he can make friends and stay fit. 


Joe is at school every day, but has afternoons after school, and the weekends available. His father tries to find times when they can spend time together so often take an afternoon off work to play sport with Joe. 


Pete commutes just a short way to work by car, so doens’t mind travelling a bit to find some good facilities and has also been very active in the past so is always up for trying out new sports.


Joe is very adept with the latest technology.
