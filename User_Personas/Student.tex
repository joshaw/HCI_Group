\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{ssub:student_description}

Jenny is a 20-year-old university student. She began playing tennis
over the summer and would like to start playing regularly, she is not
interested in any other sports.

Her university is situated in a large city. Jenny lives in a shared
house close to the universityâ€™s campus. As a student, she has a limited
budget and would prefer to play somewhere close to the university. This
would keep her travel costs down and she would be able to fit in a
round of tennis in between attending lectures. She would also prefer
places that would offer her a student discount or reduced price for
multiple bookings.

Jenny organises her daily activities and social events on her mobile
phone and would find it convenient to book sports facilities and keep
track of her bookings through an app.

		plans to go out with her friends.
