\subsubsection*{Description}
\label{ssub:student_description}

Jenny is a 20-year-old university student. She began playing tennis
over the summer and would like to start playing regularly, she is not
interested in any other sports.

Her university is situated in a large city. Jenny lives in a shared
house close to the university's campus. As a student, she has a limited
budget and would prefer to play somewhere close to the university. This
would keep her travel costs down and she would be able to fit in a
round of tennis in between attending lectures. She would also prefer
places that would offer her a student discount or reduced price for
multiple bookings.

Jenny organises her daily activities and social events on her mobile
phone and would find it convenient to book sports facilities and keep
track of her bookings through an application.

\subsubsection*{Scenarios}
\label{ssub:student_scenarios}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This semester, Jenny has no lectures on Monday mornings,
		Wednesday afternoons and between 11am and 2pm on Thursdays.
		She would like to book a tennis court for one of these times.

	\item Jenny has a major assessment deadline next week and decides
		to spend her time during the day working. However, she would
		like to book for an evening session for any day during the
		week on a clay court in order to prepare for an upcoming
		tournament.

	\item She is practicing for a tournament with a friend and they have
		agreed to play together every week. In order to help remind her
		friend of this, Jenny would like to send the booking details when she
		has booked the court and have a weekly reminder of the time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Pain Points}
\label{ssub:student_pain_points}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Jenny is only interested in tennis, and sometimes finds it difficult
		to locate this amongst all the other sports on offer.

	\item She has a limited budget; she would prefer facilities that provide
		student discounts or other offers.

	\item She would like to use sports facilities within walking distance from
		university, to fit around her timetable and to keep travel costs down.
