\section{System Usability Scale Questionnaire}
\label{sec:system_usability_scale_questionnaire}

In order to gather information about how real users interact with the system, a
System Usability Scale (SUS) Questionnaire is used. This asks users to give a
mark for each of ten questions relating the their experience with the
application. They are first given the opportunity to use the system, to
interact in any way the like and to play with the functionality that has so far
been implemented. They are then presented the questions. The questionnaire that
was used can be seen in Appendix~A.

This questionnaire was given to 9 people who had first familiarised themselves
with the system. The set of questions are all scored from 1 to 5. In order to
be able to compare them correctly, these are normalised from 1 to 4. The graph
in Figure~\ref{fig:evalGraph} shows the average score for each question.
Highlighted in red are the two questions that received the lowest scores and in
green, the highest.

\subsection{Summary of Comments}
\label{sub:summary_of_comments}

As well as the ten questions, each user was asked to comment on the good
aspects of the design, and on parts of the implementation that could be
improved.

Some of the positive comments included:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Good clean layout, nice use of colours.
	\item Clear ``Home'' screen and menus for sport location, data etc.
	\item Clear, easy to read display that allowed various ways to book a
		sporting activity.
	\item Simple flow from home screen $\rightarrow$ booking. Very few clicks
		needed to achieve desired task.
\end{itemize}

These show that the overall design of the application was clear and easy to
use, whilst still displaying all the required information, and being easy to
navigate.

From the `improvements' comments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item On ``My Bookings'', wasn't sure what sport it was.
	\item ``My Bookings'', what is temperature (is it today's temperature)?
	\item ``Select Sports'' screen, ``OK'' would have been more intuitive than
		``DONE''.
	\item Fewer sort options.
	\item The public transport section was unclear over what it meant,
		therefore i was wary to use it.
	\item The ``AM/PM'' selction in ``Time'' wasn't quite clear if I had
		selected times between selected or just selected the times.
\end{itemize}
