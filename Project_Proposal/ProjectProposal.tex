\section{Problem Situation}
\label{sec:problem_situation}

If you currently want to book sports facilities, the only way to search is
directly through the individual sports center's websites, or through direct
communication. If someone is flexible in the location or choice of sport, they
are required to search multiple locations to find the best compromise.

In addition to the difficulties of checking multiple websites, often each of
these websites are unintuitive and difficult to use, requiring the user to know
exactly when and where they want to use the facilities and often not giving
clear information about other possible factors such as cost.

\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:proposed_solution}

Therefore, we propose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A booking system for multi-activity, multi-location sport facilities,
    \item simple, clean phone/web app;
\end{itemize}
which would:
\begin{itemize}
    \item display all available facilities for all (selected) sports within
        given radius,
    \item allow comparison by price, time, sport and location,
    \item for simplicity, allow selection of time, court, etc., but leave
        payment handling to the sports center chosen, and
    \item does not require account.
\end{itemize}
