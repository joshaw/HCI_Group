    \begin{abstract}
        If you currently want to book sports facilities, the only way to search is
        directly through the individual sports center's websites, or through direct
        communication. If someone is flexible in the location or choice of sport, they
        are required to search multiple locations to find the best compromise.

        In addition to the difficulties of checking multiple websites, often each of
        these websites are unintuitive and difficult to use, requiring the user to know
        exactly when and where they want to use the facilities and often not giving clear
        information about other possible factors such as cost.


        Here, we propose a new, unified interface for finding a time, location 
        and the cost for playing any of a number of sports, at any of the 
        available locations within a given distance or relative to a different
        location.
